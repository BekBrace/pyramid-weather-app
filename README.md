## Project Description

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specified city. It provides real-time weather data such as temperature, description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, pressure, and wind speed. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will fetch and display the weather information using data from OpenWeatherMap.

**Key features of the Weather App:**

- **Real-Time Data**: The app retrieves up-to-date weather data for the specified city, ensuring accurate and current information.

- **User-Friendly**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with an easy-to-use form for entering the city name.

- **Weather Icons**: The app displays weather conditions using visual icons, making it easier for users to understand the weather at a glance.

- **Customization**: Users can easily customize the city they want to check the weather for.

The Weather App is a great tool for anyone looking to quickly check the weather conditions for a specific location, whether for travel planning, daily routines, or simply staying informed about the weather.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pyramid (for the web application)
- Jinja2 (for rendering HTML templates)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
