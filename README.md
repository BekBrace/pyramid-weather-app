üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Application Powered by Pyramid Framework for Python** üêçüîº

## Project Description

Experience the magic of the Pyramid Framework for Python with our Weather App! This web application empowers users to check real-time weather conditions for any city, providing essential data such as temperature, weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, pressure, and wind speed. Users can simply input a city name, and the app seamlessly fetches and displays the weather information, leveraging data from OpenWeatherMap.

**Key features of the Weather App:**

- **Real-Time Data**: The app fetches up-to-date weather data for the specified city, ensuring precision and currency.

- **User-Friendly**: Crafted with user-friendliness in mind, the interface boasts an intuitive form for effortlessly entering the city name.

- **Weather Icons**: Visual icons make it a breeze for users to grasp weather conditions at a glance, all thanks to the Pyramid Framework's flexibility.

- **Customization**: Personalize your experience! Users can easily customize the city they want to check the weather for.

The Weather App is your go-to tool for swiftly checking the weather conditions for a specific location, be it for travel planning, daily routines, or simply staying informed about the ever-changing weather.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pyramid (for the web application)
- Jinja2 (for rendering HTML templates)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
